**Removal of DEI utility pole**

The wooden pole that had been installed inside the settlement has now been removed and the area restored. It is a development that makes us genuinely happy and proves what the local community can achieve when it mobilizes together.

A heartfelt thank you to DEDDIE for responding immediately and for respecting the traditional character of our village.

We are especially grateful to Mariantzela Panourgia (DEDDIE Tinos), whose persistence, commitment, and interventions were decisive both for the pole’s removal and for advancing the undergrounding solution-a solution that truly suits Tarampados.

Today’s positive outcome reminds us how important it is to keep the Association and community informed before interventions happen within the village. With dialogue, tensions are avoided and everyone benefits.

Tarampados is our place, our history, and our beauty-it always deserves everyone’s respect.
