This Sunday we all shared a wonderful day dedicated to our children as we inaugurated the Tarampados playground.

Marina Dellatola prepared a special messy & sensory play session that delighted the kids, and their smiles were the greatest reward.

Our warm thanks go to Giorgos Piperis for the invaluable help with the restroom at the parish hall.

We are also grateful to Markos Dellatolas (Katsaros) for the idea and execution-a celebration we’ll now hold every year, because moments like this shouldn’t happen just once.

See you again next year!
